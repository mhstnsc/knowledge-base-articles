Narrow skinny feet with big ankles

* 2019 - Tecnica Zero G Tour Pro - Good fit for narrow and skinny feet with medium arch, alpine like flex, good range of motion
* 2019 - Scarpa Maestrale - Good fit however is for low arch, soft flex, good range of motion 
* 2019 - Scott Carbon - Painful when leaning on the shins, poor range of motion
