* campings have an annoying habbit of having a checkin only to some hour in the evening (like 6 or 7) 
so if you come too late then you cannot check-in. 
Its anoying because you might just want to go eat someplace before reaching camping and going to sleep.
* cooking in the van is annoying
* drying your wet clothes is hard thing to do
* going to toilet to some other place when it rains or is 5 deg outside is really not the coolest thing to do. 
* choose a van from which you can access your clothes from inside. If it rains outside and you forgot your pijama in the trunk....
* if you are a family pack your things around usability moments than per-person 
(all pijamas, all trekking, all cold, all swisssuits)
* small campervans means more chess playing with your things

VW california review
* more than 2 people seems horror in this thing
* it is cold on the top compartment
* little storage inside
* little storage because of the bed practically the trunk is a little thing.
