At a glance:
* 3-4 nights/4-5 days seem enough for **diamond circle** in the north => whales, vulcanoes, thermal, puffins(average), wild nature
* 2-3 nights/3-4 days seem enoug for the south => majestic waterfalls, blue lagoon, glacier golf, vulcano beach, airplane wrek, puffin colonies, glacier hikes

* season: april to may is much much cheaper and anyway is dry, some campings might be closed and whale season just starts
* campervans: can be expensive in high season to even 350euro/day
* puffins: Never approach too close to the cliff edges as the burrows that the puffins have dug make the ground lose and hollow!

**Note! Never approach too close to the cliff edges as the burrows that the puffins have dug make the ground lose and hollow!**

**Puffins do not often show any fear towards humans and approaching them very closely seems to be easy. But this doesn’t mean that they want to be touched or that they enjoy our company.  Touching a puffin is actually very harmful to them as their feathers have special properties that deflect water. Petting them ruins this. Please always be respectful towards the birds. Touching and feeding them is the worst thing you can do. **

Puffins spend most of their lives out at sea where they spread widely across the ocean, making it hard for anyone to find them. They only come ashore to lay their eggs and spend the few months of the summer in Iceland, while the chicks grow strong enough to take care of themselves.

The best time to see the puffins in Iceland is the summer. They arrive in May and leave in late August. The colony is usually the most active in evenings. The birds stand outside of their burrows, resting on the grass before heading out to sea to where they spend the night roosting.

# Whale watching

North coast (E.g Dalvik) is where the humpback whales spend their time. Also the most jumpy and playful.
