# In a nutshell

* `Lefkada` - great nature, crappy restaurants
* `Santorini` - good restaurants, expensive hotels, too much junk outside tourist areas, crappy beaches
* `Kefalonia`- a balanced mix of great nature and some decent services.
* `Corfu` - nice nature and decent beaches, good restaurants
* `Mykonos` - strong wind, super expensive beach seats, music from multiple sources, fancy breakfast, good restaurants
