# In a nutshell

* `Lefkada` - great nature, crappy restaurants, great windsurf
* `Santorini` - good restaurants, expensive hotels, too much junk outside tourist areas, crappy beaches
* `Kefalonia`- a balanced mix of grand nature and some decent services
* `Corfu` - nice nature and scenery beaches on west side, good restaurants
* `Mykonos` - strong wind, super expensive beach seats, music from multiple sources, fancy breakfast, good restaurants, some water sports
* `Kos` - green, has imigrant camp (and they are not happy)
