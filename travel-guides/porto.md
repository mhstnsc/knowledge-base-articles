Public transport

 * public transport is with zones. From airport there's option to take line E of metro. 
 * Public transport tickets need to be validated on each time a transport is taken (even if the metro line is changed). 
   I am not sure how this works when changing metro lines and going into another zone.
 * Airport is Zone 4 (for when you buy the ticket from the machine)
 * generally the old town is walkable. I found no need for taking public transport

Eating:
 * generally lots of good restaurants
 * special things
