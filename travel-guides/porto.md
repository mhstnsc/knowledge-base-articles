Public transport

 * public transport is with zones. From airport there's option to take line E of metro. 
 * Public transport tickets need to be validated on each time a transport is taken (even if the metro line is changed). 
   I am not sure how this works when changing metro lines and going into another zone.
 * Airport is Zone 4 (for when you buy the ticket from the machine)
 * generally the old town is walkable in about 20 minutes. I found no need for taking public transport. 
 * there are some cards which combine attractions with transport. AndanteCard or PortoCard

Todo :
 * generally lots of good restaurants, its better to move a bit higher than the river side where restaurants are more expensive
 * eat Pastel de Nata
 * buy canned sardines (some stores here...)
