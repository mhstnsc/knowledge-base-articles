## Applying to visa with waiver.

Its rather fast and approval comes quite fast.

## Driving in US

Changes from EU style:
  * at an intersection without traffic lights: first come, first served. Right-hand priority does not apply. If there is a queue of cars waiting on each direction is a round robin style. It is usually marked with "all give way". Otherwise if not then it might be that you either have priority or you need to give
  * At a stop sign: you need to stop
  * at a traffic light:
     * you can always make right on red light (unless forbidden by a text)
     * on green light, you can make left without worry unless specified otherwise
  * two yellow lines in the middle means a separation between directions (if its not there then its a one way street), useful in case of many lines
  * on highway
     * better to drive on the middle lines on highway if you are going straight. That is because the right ones usually go out and you might be caught on that
     * if you have on the left a dots marking it means this line will leave the highway. If you want to go straight than better to switch to left one
     * typically speed is higher than limit but quite a bit, this is fine as long as you're going with the speed of other cars (keeping the flow)
     * sometimes there are objects on the road, google does a good way to notify
