### parsehub
* easy to use
* executable on windows
* :x: binds the project to the link (so if you got parametrized links you cannot just start in the middle)
* :thumbsup: allows to navigate a tree structure and still do collection

### data miner
* chrome plugin
* found it easy to use
* :x: i could not select one instance of an object to perform an action on it
* :x: navigating a tree structure comes with money
