Ski boots
===

## Fitting
* Load the boot into your feet and stand up straight without buckling, **you should be slightly touching the front with the fingers**
* Buckle up (your ankle goes backward) and you should be able to **move fingers now and not touch the front**
* Boosts can be heat **molded to be bigger** but not smaller (through deformation at heat) so don't buy too big and maybe make sure the plastic can be heated.
* **The foot should be supported from sides** and not move sideways but you should not be compressed either
* Press forward on your shins and you should have a confortable feeling on your shins, its important because you should be skiing like this most of the time
* If you have thin shins the boot might not be snug but its not super important. You should be skiing maintaining pressure on the shins

## Flexing

Flexing is important and comes to play in case of absorbing shocks, energy transfer, etc . Boots should not be too stiff or too flexing. 
* There is no standard flex index consistent between producers
* flex index is consistent between same producer (generally :)
* touring boots are generally less flexible than alpine boots at the same flex index

How to test:
* Buckle up and press forward on your shins. 
* You should be able to **bend the boots until your knees are above the front of the boots** but not beyond. 
* Mind that in the store is warm and plastic is more pliable so maybe exceed a bit the front

# Ski poles
* Falling on ski poles might bend them especially in powder so mind they can get damaged quickly if you fall a lot

# Ski bindings
* not all tec bindings have same safery (release) features as you would expect like in the alpine bindings so you should be at a good skier level to use them safely

# Gloves
* if you got cold fingers, get a pair of mittens
