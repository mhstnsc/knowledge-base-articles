#### Day 1: mix...
* 2 tablespoons whole grain flour* (wheat or rye)
* 2 tablespoons pineapple juice, orange juice, or apple cider

#### Day 2: add...
* 2 tablespoons whole grain flour*
* 2 tablespoons juice or cider

##### Day 3: add...
* 2 tablespoons whole grain flour*
* 2 tablespoons juice or cider

##### Day 4: (and once daily until it starts to expand and smell yeasty), mix . . .
* 2 oz. of the starter (1/4 cup after stirring down-discard the rest)
* 1 oz. flour** (scant 1/4 cup)
* 1 oz. water (2 tablespoons)

* Organic is not a requirement, nor does it need to be freshly ground.

** You can feed the starter/seed culture whatever you would like at this point. White flour, either bread or a strong unbleached all-purpose like King Arthur or a Canadian brand will turn it into a general-purpose white sourdough starter. Feed it rye flour if you want a rye sour, or whole wheat, if you want to make 100% whole wheat breads. If you're new to sourdough, a white starter is probably the best place to start.
