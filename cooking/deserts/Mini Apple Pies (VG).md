# Mini Apple Pies (24pc)

## Crust
See recipe for "Coconut Oil Pie Crust (VG).txt"


## Filling ingredients
- 2.5kg apples
- 50g sugar
- 2tsp cinnamon (optional).
- 24 walnut halves (optional).

## Filling steps
De-skin the apples and grate them in a pot.

Add sugar and mix well.

Put pot on a stove at medium-high heat (7/10) and cook until liquid evaporates. Be careful to stir from time to time so the bottom apples don't get burnt.

Optional: When nearly done, add the cinnamon and mix well. Wait for a few more minutes and then take off the stove.

Transfer apple mixture into a collander to cool and drain even more. 

Start preparing the crust (see instructions in separate recipe).


## Combining steps
When crust dough is all mixed up, turn on the oven and set to 350F (180C).

Spread the dough with rolling pin and cut circles that fit the muffin tin.  
Put apple mixture in each hole. 

Optional Add one walnut halve on top.  

Bake in pre-heated oven for 42 minutes. When ready, the dough will have a golden color to it.
