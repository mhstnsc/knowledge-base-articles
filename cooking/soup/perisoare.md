## Procedure

1. Mix all the **meatballs** ingredients and keep mixing with a wood spoon or whatever 
until the meat proteins bind and becomes like a paste, 
you feel you need more power to mix it 
2. Warm the 2l of waters and bring it to almost boil
3. Take a spoon of **meat and make it a ball** and gently lower it into the hot water, repeat until no more meat left
4. Increase the heat to a gentle boil and periodically **take the foam** (coagulated blood) out
5. Let it **boil** until you prepare the vegetables, i guess about 15-20 minutes
6. Add the **roots, peperoni, tomato, onion** into the pot
7. Let it **boil** for 30 minutes
8. Lower the heat, take the eggs and kind of stir them a bit to break them, like an omlette but not so much, gently drip the eggs into the soup. 
It will start making like sheets of paper in the soup. Let them **boil** for 3-4 minutes.
9. Take it off the fire.
10. **This is critical part** Start adding lemon juice, gradual and tasting, until the taste becomes balanced, its a subtle change, 
you should not feel sour (or you could) but it should not feel sweet either.
11. Add salt to taste.
13. Add a spoon for chopped liebstockel.
14. Serve using the ingredients for serving.
