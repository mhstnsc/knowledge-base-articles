# Summer camping
  
  - Sleeping bag
    * UGQ Bandit Quilt for -6 deg comfort.
      * Sleeping with quilt is finicky because of the drafts. Especially if you're turning a lot.
      * Can attack quilt to the sides but this only works in theory. In practice when turning, the sides move the attackments move again. The quilt can also be clamped from each side together but then also touching the sleeping pad is not ideal because in cold temperatures the matress is also cold
  
  - Matress
    * Thermarest Neoair XLite
      * the mummy profile is annoying as hands or feet are sometimes out of the matress
      * its REALY noisy, can wake you up when turning
      * sleeping on the side is not great
  
  - Boots
    * La Sportiva TX4 (so far the best shoes i've had)
      * super grip, best grip on all kind of surfaces
      * takes a big time to break them
      * rather flexible sole makes it easy to walk
      * deemed as approach shoes, can be used for climbing
      * the low profile makes it less adequate for 3k style peaks where loose rocks can hit the ankles which happened several times
    * La Sportiva 

# Winter camping


  - Sleeping bags.  
    According to weather history (see resources) the temperature on santis (2500m) peaks at -15 but is around -11.  
    Pay attention to the width, if there is too much space inside it won't be as warm as a snug fit
    * Western Mountaineering Kodiak - very wide girth, -11 comfort
    * Western Mountaineering Lynx MF - a bit narrow girth, -18 comfort (probably), big volume 18l, 1.5kg
    * (selected for the small size)  Mountain Hardwear Phantom -18 - narrow girth, -11 comfort, 9l packed, 1.2 kgweb

  - Matress  
    Should have R-value of 5 at least.   
    50 cm mummy matress, has problems that the hands or feet fall out of the matress.  

  - Socks
    * VBL socks


  - Cooking
    A gas stove might not work well in cold because of the gas mix which does [not vaporize from certain temperatures](https://www.outdoors.org/resources/amc-outdoors/gear/why-do-canister-stoves-fail-in-cold/).   
    
    - Gas options
