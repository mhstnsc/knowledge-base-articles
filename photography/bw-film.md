My own film reviews

 * Ilford FP4 125.    - Feels a bit too contrasty and is clipping highlights in high contrast, maybe the printing is more delicate as a stock print. I did not do my own prints yet
 * Ilford Delta 100.  - TBSHot
 * Ilford XP2 160     - Less grain than FP4, seems to handle highlights better, really good detail in landscapes in winter
