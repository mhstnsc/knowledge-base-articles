The negative

 * Should not be super high contrast, then is hard to get, mostly just some special films do that


Total duration a picture is about
 * 5m chemicals (1 propper exposure) x 5 exposures => 25m
 * 5m decisions
 * 1m drying

Aprox 45min-1h / picture

With normal light:
 * verify the PH of the stop (should be around 3,4)
 * verify the PH & Aluminium of the fix
 * prepare the frame which holds the paper
    * setup the top left corner
    * setup the right side by using some pen
    * make it red and start a projection
    * adjust the projection to fit the frame (up - down)
    * adjust the focus by using the loupe, you should see the grain of the film
  * make a test with 2,4,8,16 using less paper or not
  * start with whatever setting and make a full exposure (or another test, not sure)
  * once you got the expore right see if you need any corrections like touch & burn
  * put it to develop for 1m30s (keep shaking the trays)
  * put it to stop for 30s-1m
  * put it to fix for 2m
  * wash for 5min-30m
  * start the dryer and wait for it to warm up
  * dry the images

Process controlls:
 * more time => less brightess, more dark overall, less while => default make a test with 2,4,8,16s
 * more grade => more contrast => default 3
 * bigger apperture => more exposure time
 * paper matte => more time (2x) as glossy (there's also half mate
