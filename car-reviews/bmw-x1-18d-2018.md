# Comments

* Navigator took me to some strange streets in the city and outside
* :thumbsup: Navigator pretty good showing parking by default.
* :thumbsup: Plenty of room for ski of 167 length.
* :x: Rear seats can be locked in any position but weird way of raising them.
* Display is not sluggish
* Touchscreen
* :thumbsup: Google search for locations on map
* 5.9l/km in my trip on average (considering also there were mountain roads)
* :thumbsup: Adaptive speed control was good and could control speed well throughout the range even when a car slides in or something.
* :thumbsup: Size of car was OK, did not feel big even in tight parkings.
* :thumbsup: Distance sensors would also show the spoiler alert which is nice in rough terrain.
* :x: Signal control crap. Depending on auto cancel does not work and then with manual cancel its a game of left vs right to fix it.
