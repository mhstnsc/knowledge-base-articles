# Comments

* Navigator took me to some strange streets in the city and outside
* Navigator pretty good showing parking by default.
* Plenty of room for ski of 167 length.
* Rear seats can be locked in any position but weird way of raising them.
* Display is not sluggish
* Touchscreen
* Google search for locations on map
* 5.9l/km in my trip on average (considering also there were mountain roads)
* Adaptive speed control was good and could control speed well throughout the range even when a car slides in or something.
* Size of car was OK, did not fell big even in tight parkings.
* Distance sensors would also show the spoiler alert which is nice in rough terrain.
* Signal control crap. Depending on auto cancel does not work and then with manual cancel its a game of left vs right to fix it.
