## Comments

* :thumbsup: really big boot space for the size of the car (most spatious and compact car i tried so far with some cool folding back seats). 
it was easy to fit the ski gear for 7 day holiday.
The rear trunk door allows to put bags right to the edge.
* lots of foot space for the rear passengers
* responsive computer with touch screen
* speed and other displays to the side so driver has to look down and right always. 
* navigator display to the most right side of the display (rather annoying to keep looking right)
* :x: rather sluggish acceleration with some delay between pressing acceleration and the car reacting but well, one can accept it as a compromise.
* no adaptive speed control
