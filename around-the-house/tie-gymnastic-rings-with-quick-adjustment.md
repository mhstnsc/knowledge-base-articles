### Hang to a bar (ring + rope-2x-length) with infinite adjustment

* Tie one head of the rope to the ring with a double slide when pulling knot. 
* Run the other head over the hanging bar, all the way back to the ring and through the ring (if you don't want to much adjustment and you want to cut on rope length then just make some some butterfly knot somewhere.
* make a 8 knot from the free head. It will self lock on tension but quickly release with no tension so you can adjust. 

### Hang to a bar (ring + rope-1x-length + carabiner) with discrete adjustment
* Tie one head of the rope to the ring with a double slide when pulling knot. 
* Make some butterfly knots along
* use the carabiner to adjust
