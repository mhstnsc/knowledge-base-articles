* practice technique before...duh

## Pre-climb ##
 * tie rope to the carpet on both ends so you know it will not
 * check rope for lumps
 * rope is fine as long as you do not see white

## Pre-ascent ##
 * have 12 quickdraws (take more)
 * no space at the harness level.
 * tie knot as close as possible to the harness. 

## leading ## 
 * be mindful of the direction of the pull when setting quickdraws
 * clipping wrongly its not super bad, better go on and clip correctly 
 * if you clip from below last clip then unclip the closest one and clip the rope going to belayer
 
## Anchor ##
  * always work under tension, do not release tension thinking its just a few CM to cover.
  * undo a quick draw and set it in opposite directions if no carabiener is available.

## clear route ## 
  * make sure to clip to the rope if its not straight
  * leave one clip higher and climb back to make sure you do not swing huge distances when unclipping from the belayer rope
